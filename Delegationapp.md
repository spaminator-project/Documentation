# Existing Delegation Received
1. *When did you get the delegation?* 

1 June 2018

To allow sufficient Steem Power for a large-scale anti-abuse effort. 

4. *How have you applied your delegation for that purpose?* 

The delegation was granted by Ned Scott on behalf of Steemit, Inc. 

5. *How long are you requesting the continuation with the delegation?* 

2 years 

On @spaminator-warn (50k) and @spaminator-clear (remainder) accounts. We are not requesting a pure renewal of delegation for the @spaminator account but a move. 

The purpose of the change is to optimize the naming convention and make it clearer for users.

# Market
*Please limit responses to 300 characters.
What problem is the product/project solving?*

Spaminator aims to deter large-scale reward and account exploitation attempts by systemically removing rewards from comments and posts. It focuses on the act of farming or spam for the detrimental purposes of extraction and differentiates between that and service bots or interactions with a meaning. It's scope is fluid and gets revisited on a semi-annual basis, keeping it relevant to currently-applicable scenarios. 

# Core Team Details
*Please limit responses to 500 characters for each team member.*

*Write short summaries about each core team member including their achievements to show they have a strong track record. Add links to their LinkedIn profiles to this section.*
 
**@Guiltyparties** is a former developer and decentralized venture leader who took over the @Spaminator project from @Patrice who is currently away due to personal circumstances. He joined the Steemcleaners team after personal initiatives to combat fraud while educating users. He has over 20 years experience in organisation and leadership, which he uses to liaise between the Steemcleaners family of projects and the Steem ecosystem. He is also a witness, managing developer of the BROSGN family of gaming sites, interim board member of the Steem Foundation, and founder of DLine. 

Github: https://github.com/gryter

**@Patrice** is the Founder of the @Spaminator project and is currently involved in an Advisory Role. 

# Minimum Viable Products
*Please limit responses to 500 characters per product.*

*Provide links to your minimum viable products and describe it. If it is not available, please describe it and include how you plan to build it and when it will be built.*

The backend involves a management website and API. It allows members of the Steemcleaners team to add users, activate and deactivate them, add and manage groups, and see various helpful information pulls. 

The bot backend is a comprehensive Python framework using the Beem library. It runs both the warning downvote (@mack-bot) and the reward pool return funds downvote (@spaminator) accounts at once. It is designed to be modular and can incorporate any number of accounts in a diverse manner.

# Business Strategy
Please limit responses in this section to 250 characters per question.

1. Fiat Revenue Strategy: [E.g. We plan to sell NFTs which represent in-game items for US Dollars]

This initiative is non-profit and does not generate a positive income for the purpose of returns. 

2. Fiat Revenue Projections in $/user every month: [E.g. $10/user]

N/A

3. How will your business strategy increase the amount of STEEM being powered up and/or burnt?

The calculations involved in the Spaminator Framework will be adjusted to scale with and fit the Steem ecosystem. Going forward, should the project produce revenue beyond what is needed to support the cost of the infrastructure, the remainder STEEM will be burned.

4. What financial incentives are you willing to provide to Steemit, Inc. and/or the Steem Community in return for the delegation? i.e. What's your skin in the game? [E.g. project tokens, revenue-share, etc.] (Without a return there's not a partnership, it's simply a contribution, and one that's easily left behind. In order to encourage businesses and communities to commit to the Steem blockchain and ecosystem long term there needs to be both a contract and a mutually beneficial partnership.)

@Spaminator restores funds to the reward pool, amplifying the utility of the Steem Community. It also detects, deters and removes organized exploitation groups and covert reward drain attempts. This increases the utility, marketability, and general well-being of the Steem ecosystem, leading to cost-saving measures and residual positive side effects.

5. Are you or how will you become financially sustainable once the delegation is removed?

We will seek alternative delegation sources.

2 years

*Which one of the following answers best describes how the delegation will be used to add direct value to Steem:*
A. It will be used to create new accounts.
B. It will be used to give new accounts 15 SP to give them the resources needed to use Steem and purchase goods and/or services through our platform.
C. It will be used to incentivize the creation of content that promotes Steem / your project on external platforms.
D. It will be used to provide limited trial or discount services to clients to encourage them to hold Steem and delegate in the future.

It will be used to ensure the continued resiliency of the Steem blockchain against spam and malicious exploitation and to return illicitly gained rewards to the communal reward pool.

# Agreement
*We agree that our business will continue to leverage the Steem blockchain as long as we are receiving a delegation and 1 year following the removal of the delegation. During this time we also agree to promote the Steem blockchain as a valuable technological protocol that delivers unique value. We are willing to sign a legally binding contract with Steemit, Inc. to this effect.*

I formally agree and accept.

N/A

8. *How much Steem Power is delegated to your project from the Steem community?*

59,855 SP

9. *For the KPIs listed above, back report progress for the duration of the delegation on a quarter by quarter basis.*

Please see KPI table above.

10. *How much Steem / SBD has your project burned?*

N/A

11. *Describe what value the project continues to bring to the Steem community and why the community should continue to support your project?*

@Spaminator is an objective anti-abuse project that aims to restore rewards to the communal reward pool while detecting and deterring organized exploitation attempts. Much of its work is under the surface and is not clearly visible to the average user. This is because organized exploitation attempts are usually well-hidden and masqueraded to avoid detection. 

To put it into perspective, roughly 25k accounts on the @Spaminator action list are owned by a single entity who automated their actions in a very diverse and creative way to avoid detection. While some users may disagree with downvoting or the very concept of anti-abuse, everyone can agree that massive, unmanned exploitative farms are detrimental and must be eradicated from the ecosystem.

12. *Describe your project roadmap with expected timelines and milestones.*

We are looking at developing a way for community members to positively engage with and contribute to the @Spaminator project. We will have our official roadmap ready early in 2019 Q4. 

We will also formulating a STEEM burn methodology.

The goal is to make this a true community project.
